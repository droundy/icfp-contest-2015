Team Ξίφων and the Physicists

Note that Ξίφων is transliterated Xiphon and pronounced Ziffun.

Our program is written in rust 1.2, primarily by four physicists, but
with some help from two dogs.

Our executable supports a number of non-standard command-line flags
for different behavior, which you can examine using the --help flag.

The most fun flag is --animate TIME_PER_FRAME_IN_MILLISECONDS, which
shows a nice animation of the solution.

The algorithm we use is based on three main functions:

1. a path-finding algorithm `find_path_dhs` (which sometimes tries to
   use phrases of power, but without accounting for their score
   benefits),

2. a function `enumerate_resting_dependencies`, which lists all the
   places we might want a given block to land (but not all the places
   it *could* land), assuming a bottom-up filling strategy.

3. a function `Solver::solve` that uses the two above to pick the best
   sequence of landing places, and the most beneficial paths to those
   places.  As you can see, `solve` supports several different
   algorithms, which can be selected using a command-line flag.
